# Test for Difference in Means (t-tests, ANOVA)

Tips before you start:
- You can pull up documentation for a function by executing `?function_name` (e.g. `?t.test`) in the Console.
- Throughout this workshop, instead of typing in commands directly in the command line or in the code editor, type them in chunks of code in your .Rmd file.

## One-sample t-test

**One-sample t-test** is a hypothesis test to see whether the mean of a dataset is significantly different from a value.

As an example, we have test scores for a sample of 8 students. The scores are 62, 67, 69, 70, 72, 75, 80, and 90. We use a one-sample t-test to see if the sample mean is significantly **different** from 65 at the 0.05 level. The null hypothesis is that μ = 65 (μ is a character usually used to indicate population mean). 

In the Code Editor (inside a chunk of code in your RMarkdown file), create a data vector called `scores`, and then click Ctrl + Enter (PC) or Cmd + Enter (Mac) to run the code in the command line.
        
```{r scores}
# Create the vector with score values
score <- c(62, 67, 69, 70, 72, 75, 80, 90)
```
        
Conduct a one-sample t-test and report the t-statistic and p-value. By default, the test performs a two-sided test, which means the alternative hypothesis is that μ is different from 65. Add to the code chunk in your RMarkdown file, and then send to the command line:
    
```{r one-sample-t-test1}
# Perform a one-sample t-test to test if the mean of the sample is different than 65
t.test(score, mu = 65)
```

The p-value of 0.03275 is smaller than 0.05, so we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the population mean is significantly different from 65.
        
You can also test a directional hypothesis, for example if the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is **greater** than 65 at the .05 level. To do that, you need to specify the `alternative` argument in the `t.test()` function. The parameter of this argument must be one of the following: `"two.sided"` (which is the default), `"greater"`, or `"less"`, depending on whether the alternative hypothesis is that the mean is different than, greater than or less than μ, respectively.

Therefore, to test if the population mean is greater than 65, add the following in a code chunk in your RMarkdown file, and then send to the command line:

```{r one-sample-t-test2}
# Perform a one-sample t-test to test if the mean of the sample is greater than 65
t.test(score, mu = 65, alternative = "greater")
```
        
The p-value of 0.01638 is smaller than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the population mean is significantly greater than 65.
        
Try conducting a one-sample t-test where the alternative hypothesis is the mean is less than 65. What is the R command and what is your conclusion?


## Two-sample t-test

A **two-sample t-test** is a hypothesis test to see whether there is a significant difference between the means of two samples.

Consider two pizza companies, A and B. We want to test if there is a significant difference in the average pizza delivery times between A and B. Following are the data collected from a sample of delivery times (in minutes). μA = μB is the null hypothesis

```{r pizza-table, echo = FALSE}
pizza <- data.frame(
  Delivery.Time.A = c(25.4, 29.2, 20.4, 26.4, 25.2, 23.5, 26.5),
  Delivery.Time.B = c(25.2, 21.9, 23.5, 22.3, 25.5, 23.6, 22.3)
)
knitr::kable(pizza, "html", col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(pizza)))
```

Create two vectors for the delivery time of company A and company B in a code chunk in your RMarkdown file, and then send it to the command line.
    
```{r delivery-times}
# Create vectors with delivery times
companyA <- c(25.4, 29.2, 20.4, 26.4, 25.2, 23.5, 26.5)
companyB <- c(25.2, 21.9, 23.5, 22.3, 25.5, 23.6, 22.3)
```
    
Conduct a two-sample t test and report the t and p values by adding the following in a code chunk in your RMarkdown file, and then sending it to the command line:
    
```{r two-sample-t-test1}
# Performs two-sample t-test to test for difference in means
t.test(companyA, companyB)
```
        
From the output, we can see that the p-value is 0.167 > 0.05. Hence, there is no strong evidence showing the difference in the average times to deliver a pizza between Company A and Company B.
        
In the same way as for the one-sample t-test, you can specify different alternative hypothesis in the argument `alternative`. Try conducting a two-sample t-test where the alternative hypothesis is Company A delivers pizzas faster than Company B. What is the R command and what’s your conclusion?

## One-way ANOVA

**One-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** is a hypothesis test to determine whether the means from more than two populations or groups are equal or not.

As an example, suppose that four basketball teams took a random sample of players regarding how high each player can jump (in inches). μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4 is the null hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is at least one μ is statistically different from the rest.

We first input the data into an appropriate format (add to a code chunk in your RMarkdown file, and then send it to the command line).
        
```{r jump-heights}
# Create vector of jump heights (in inches)
height <- c(36, 42, 51, 32, 35, 38, 48, 50, 39, 38, 44, 46)
# Create vector of team names
team <- c(rep("T1",3), rep("T2",3), rep("T3", 3), rep("T4", 3))
# Merge
df <- data.frame(height, team)
# Visualize the data
print(df)
```
        
We can make a boxplot to visualize the data by team. Add the following to a code chunk in your RMarkdown file, and then send it to the command line:
    
```{r boxplot}
# Box plot of jump height  for each team
boxplot(height ~ team, data = df, main = "Jump height across team")
```
        
The function aov() can be used for fitting ANOVA models. The general form is `aov(response ~ factor, data = data_name)`, where response represents the response variable and factor the variable that separates the data into groups. Once the ANOVA model is fit, we use the summary() function to view the result, which is in a standard ANOVA table. Add the following to a code chunk in your RMarkdown file, and then send it to the command line:
    
```{r anova}
# Fits the anova model
model <- aov(height ~ team, data = df)
# See results
summary(model)
```
        
With a p-value of 0.172 (which is larger than 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that the mean jump height of any group is different from the other.
