# Generate Reports With R Markdown

If you haven’t done so already, please install R Markdown and LaTeX on your computer. For instructions, go back to the [Pre-Workshop Activities](pre-workshop.html) page.

1. Read parts 1 - 6 of the [RMarkdown Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html){:target="_blank"}
2. For the rest of the workshop, we will save our code on a R Markdown file. Let's create this file in RStudio. The steps are similar to described in the cheatsheet.
-   Open RStudio, click **File -> New File -> RMarkdown...**
-   Enter title, author, and select the type of output format **PDF** and click **OK**
-   After creating your R Markdown file, you must save it. Click **File -> Save As ->...** Enter the filename and make sure to remember where you saved it.
-   The Markdown document with some example code will appear on your Editor window.

    <img src="images/act-1/icon.png" alt="small icon" style="float:right;width:120px;">

-   Click the **Knit** icon in the toolbar (see image of the icon on the right to know what to look for). A PDF file is now generated and saved to the current folder/directory.
-   Continue editing this R Markdown document for other Activities.
